# Number_guessing_game
A number guessing game is a simple and engaging game where players try to guess a hidden number within a specified range. 

Objective:
The primary goal is for the player to guess the correct number chosen by the game within the least number of attempts.

Basic Rules:
Range Selection: The game starts by defining a range of numbers (e.g., 1 to 100).
Number Generation: The game randomly selects a secret number within the defined range. This number remains hidden from the player.
Player's Turn: The player makes a guess by selecting a number within the specified range.
Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the game provides feedback to help the player adjust their next guess:
Too High: If the guessed number is higher than the secret number, the game indicates that the guess is too high.
Too Low: If the guessed number is lower than the secret number, the game indicates that the guess is too low.
Winning Condition: The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. When the correct guess is made, the game announces that the player has won and may also display the number of attempts taken.


Example Gameplay:
Range Selection: The game sets the range from 1 to 100.
Number Generation: The game randomly selects the number 42 (unknown to the player).
